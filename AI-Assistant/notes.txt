Our Mission
To Create Unforgettable
Memories For Every Child
At Area 51, each centre is designed to deliver an unforgettable play experience – but
not every location is the same
. While some of our venues are built for all ages to explore and enjoy, others are specifically designed for kids aged up to 12 years old.
Activities and
play structures vary from one site to another
, so we encourage families to
check what’s available at your chosen location before visiting
. No matter which Area 51 you explore, fun, adventure, and imagination await!
Growing Galaxy
From Underwood to Redcliffe and beyond — the mission for fun has only just begun! New locations are preparing for launch in the coming months, so keep your eyes on the stars and your space suits ready… the next Area 51 could be landing near you!
